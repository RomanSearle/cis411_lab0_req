## 1. Overview
The buisness problem is that a memeber of Messiah University would like to order a meal from a campus provider and have it delivered to my classroom. In order for this to happen a user will login to the application using their Messiah College SSO id. They will then be shown a user interface that looks similar to the one already in place for the Union and Falcon. The user will enter a time and location for the order. They will then be prompted to authenticate their order and pay using dining dollars or a credit or debt card. This order will then go to the chef who will cook and send the food and order card to the food deliverer. This person will take the food to the person who made the order. The person who ordered can now happily eat their meal.
